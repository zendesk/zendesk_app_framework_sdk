## What is it?

The Zendesk App Framework (ZAF) SDK is a JavaScript library that simplifies cross-frame communication between iframed apps and [ZAF](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/core-api/client_api). See [App Framework v2](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/apps-v2/getting_started) to learn more.

## For development...

You will need:

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/)

You should then be able to install node:
`asdf install nodejs 12.10.0`

Then run:

`npm install` - Install dependencies
`npm run build` - Build production
`npm run build:dev` - Build development version of the SDK, omitting minification
`npm run server` - Serve compiled JavaScript files at [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001)

#### Linting
